Thanks for your purchase of Azure[Sky].

The "Precomputed Sky" and "Standard Sky" demo scenes are set up in the same way as shown in the standalone you downloaded on the
Asset Store page for testing. So if you have Horizon[ON], just import it for your project, which then you will be able to play the scenes in
the same way as it is advertised on the Azure[Sky] page in the Asset Store.

PS: You may need to drag again to the scene one of the Horizon[ON] prefabs located in the folder: Assets/Azure[Sky] Dynamic Skybox/Scenes/Terrain.
